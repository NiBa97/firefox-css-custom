# firefox-css-custom
A modified version of Andreas Grafen's "ag-proton" design for firefox.

In order to use this script, get the main `userChrome.css` from the original project (can be found here: https://github.com/andreasgrafen/ag.proton) and append the Styles from the `customCss.css` of this repository.
